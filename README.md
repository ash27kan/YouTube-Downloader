# YouTube-Downloader

YouTube Downloader (In Progress)
This is my first personal project aimed at creating a YouTube downloader using Python. The script is currently incomplete, and I am still working on understanding and addressing YouTube's security measures that prevent unauthorized downloading of videos.

- Current State: Incomplete
- Future Plans: I plan to research and implement solutions to handle YouTube's security measures effectively.
- Contributions: Feel free to contribute or provide suggestions on how to improve this project. Any help or guidance on dealing with YouTube's security measures would be greatly appreciated!
